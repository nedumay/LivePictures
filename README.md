Drawing app. In development... Update: 12.01.2025

What's new: Fix colors 

Download: ...

Application сapabilities ::
1. Canvas - a working area for drawing with a “paper” background, recognizing the user's drawing actions.
2. Top and bottom menus.
3. Drawing tools: a pencil that leaves traces of the chosen color on the canvas, following your finger, and an eraser that erases these traces from the canvas, also following the movement of your finger.
4. Drawing color change control with the ability to select any color.
5. Buttons to cancel and return the last action. For pencil and eraser.

Currently in the works: 

6. The button to create the next frame. When you press it, the current frame is saved for later playback, and a blank canvas appears on the screen.
7. The button of deleting the current frame, which returns the user to the drawing of the previous frame.
8. Start and stop animation playback. When starting playback, you should turn off or hide all controls except the canvas on which the frames are played, as well as the playback stop button.
9. Redesign of the entire UI.
